The key insight is that for each number, you know exactly what the other number should be (target - current).\n\n**Step 2: Choose your data structure**\nA hash map is perfect here because you need O(1) lookup time.\n\n**Step 3: Algorithm outline**\n```\nfor each number in array:\n    complement = target - number\n    if complement in hash_map:\n        return [hash_map[complement], current_index]\n    hash_map[number] = current_index\n```\n\n**Step 4: Edge cases to consider**\n- What if the same number appears twice?\n- What if no solution exists?\n\nTry implementing this approach!",
    "Here's a detailed walkthrough:\n\n**Problem Analysis:**\nYou're looking for two indices where the sum equals target. The naive approach would be O(nÂ²), but we can do better.\n\n**Key Insight:**\nFor any number `nums[i]`, the number we're looking for is `target - nums[i]`. If we've seen this complement before, we have our answer.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Create an empty hash map\n2. For each element with index i:\n   - Calculate complement = target - nums[i]\n   - If complement exists in map, return [map[complement], i]\n   - Otherwise, store nums[i] -> i in map\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n)\n**Space Complexity:** O(n)\n\nThis is much more efficient than the brute force approach!",
